			<h3><b>A Dating Website:</b> By Christians, For Christians</h3>
			<p>I felt the online Christian dating community was lacking. Many sites seemed to have specific features I enjoyed but I could not find one that had all the features I wanted, in one place.</p>
			<p>I wanted to make a dating website whose core features were free as well as provide a relaxed atmosphere for Christian dating, not focused on denominational ritual, but rather, providing users a simple vessel to chat and build relationships, romantic or otherwise, centered around their love for Christ.</p>
			<p>LoveThroughChrist is my response to what I have always wanted in a Christian dating website.</p>
			<p>I hope you enjoy your time using it as much as I have had building it.</p>
