		<h2>A very sincere 'Thank You' for your donation!</h2>
		<p>LoveThroughChrist currently is built and maintained by a single developer.  Your donations help improve your experience by providing me the resources needed to pay for hosting and marketing while keeping the site free to use along with being able to add new features and updates (or make fixes) whenever possible.</p>
		<p>If you have any feedback about changes you would like to see or just technical issues you may be having, please feel free to send an email by clicking the 'feedback' button on the bottom left of the screen.</p>
